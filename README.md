### Files

 Grab the files needed to get the plates made or modified in KiCad [here](https://github.com/aureliengmichaud/Europa/tree/master/Plates). DXF and SVG files are included, depending on the manufacturer's needs. If you choose to get them made in PCB material (FR-4), you'll find the gerbers for the switch plate [here](https://github.com/aureliengmichaud/Europa/blob/master/Europa-Switch-Plate-Gerbers-Rev1.zip) and the bottom plate [here](https://github.com/aureliengmichaud/Europa/blob/master/Europa-Bottom-Plate-Gerbers-Rev1.zip).
